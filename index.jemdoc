== About me
I am an AI researcher specializing in large language models (LLM), focusing on the efficient 
development and robust evaluation of computer systems that automate economically 
viable yet tedious tasks typically requiring human intervention. 
My current areas of interest include:

- *Expanding AI's Impact:* Identifying novel use cases for automation with LLM and 
novel tasks for increasing professionals' productivity. Developing frameworks for robust evaluation of AI agents.
Sourcing diverse data to address unique challenges in emerging applications. 
- *Multimodal Modeling:* Integrating video and other sensory modalities into AI reasoning to advance robotics and other cyber-physical systems applications. Enhancing large language models' capabilities in 
computer programming and mathematical problem-solving.
- *Core Machine Learning and Scaling:* Addressing efficiency challenges and fundamental obstacles to expand the 
computational resources available to AI systems. Optimizing the design of modeling experiments and 
developing predictable training processes.

\p
I teach courses and supervise projects on language modeling and associated topics
within ECE and ICS departments of UH Manoa.
Previously, I worked on the large-scale distributed computing experiments and
training codebase for large language modeling within Meta AI, which contributed
to the release of the famous LLaMa models.
\n
\n
My background is in Applied Mathematics and Operations Research. In 2022, I graduated with a Ph.D.
in Engineering from UC Berkeley, where I worked on learning algorithms for data analysis and control of complex safety-critical systems.
My dissertation under the supervision of [http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~lavaei/ Professor Javad Lavaei] spans the theory of non-convex and conic optimization, stochastic control, machine learning,
focusing on computational and sampling complexity of learning algorithms. I designed data processing algorithms 
that are robust to noise and highly scalable with the amount of available computational resources.
