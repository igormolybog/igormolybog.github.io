== About me
I am a researcher working on the training of Generative Artificial Intelligence. My research 
interests cover the area of computational techniques for learning from data
that are highly scalable with the availability of the compute. More specifically, I am working on optimizers 
and model architecture scaling schemes that would allow predictable 
and efficient training of Transformer models containing hundreds of billions of parameters.

In 2022, I graduated with a Ph.D. from the group of [http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~lavaei/ Professor Javad Lavaei] at the Department of 
Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at University of California, Berkeley, where I worked
on problems of algorithmic analysis and optimal control of complex safety-critical systems, such as power systems, 
transportation and telecommunication networks, AI recommendation and navigation systems, robotic systems, and others.
My research spanned the theory of non-convex and conic optimization, stochastic control, machine learning,
and computational and sampling complexity of learning algorithms. I designed data processing algorithms 
that are robust to noise and highly scalable with the amount of available computational resources.
